# AI_CNN_project
Snapchat and Instagram filter classification using CNN.
Project for AI exam with Ivan Bratko, Faculty of Computer Science, Ljubljana 2019.

In the cnn.py file you can find the implementation of the CNN using Keras and Tensorflow libraries with Python version 3.

If you don't have these libraries installed uncomment the first lines of the code, and then they will be automatically installed.

Moreover you can find the files with all the images, splitted in training and test set. If you want to test the cnn and find out if it can correctly predict the images with Instagram dogs and cats' filters you only have to add to test set this kind of images and test it.



Also a confusion matrix is built, in order to perform the accuracy of the model.
